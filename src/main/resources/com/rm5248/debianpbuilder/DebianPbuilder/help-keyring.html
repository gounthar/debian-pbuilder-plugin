    <p>The keyring to build with.  By default, we will attempt to figure out
    if we are building a Debian package on Ubuntu, and if we think that we are
    this will be set to /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg.
    This file is part of the debian-archive-keyring package.  
    If you need to use a custom keyring, put it in here.  If for some reason 
    the auto-detection is not working properly, set this to the string 
    'disabled' and no keyring settings for pbuilder will be set.
