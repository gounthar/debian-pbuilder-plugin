	Generate a spec file to be used with Artifactory in order to upload
	files.  By default, this will generate the file with the .deb, .tar*
	and .gz files for uploading.

	<br/>
	This will generate a spec file in the workspace called artifactory-spec-debian-pbuilder/debian-pbuilder.spec
	which you can then use to upload the binaries to Artifactory.  This is intended to be used
	in conjunction with the Artifactory Jenkins plugin.
