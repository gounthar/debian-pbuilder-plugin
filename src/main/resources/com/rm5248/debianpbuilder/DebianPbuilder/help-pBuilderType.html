    The PBuilder type selects what backend to use for building.  Cowbuilder
    implements copy-on-write semantics, but can be very slow when building for
    a foreign architecture.  PBuilder can be much faster, but relies on
    installing foreign packages into the chroot, so any packages you install
    must have multiarch support.

    This will default to using Cowbuilder if not set.
