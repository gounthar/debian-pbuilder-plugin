<p>
    Set this to mark this as building a tag.  When a build comes from a tag, 
    the deb version does not get incremented(i.e. it is exactly as set in the 
    debian/changelog file).
    
    If using SVN, this plugin automatically looks at the SVN_URL_1 environment 
    variable to see if the string "tags/" exists.  If it does, the build will 
    act as though this parameter is set.
    
    If using Git, this plugin automatically looks at the GIT_BRANCH environment 
    variable to see if the string "tags/" exists.  If it does, the build will 
    act as though this parameter is set.
    
    Alternatively, you can also set the environment variable 
    DEB_PBUILDER_BUILDING_TAG to either true or false.
