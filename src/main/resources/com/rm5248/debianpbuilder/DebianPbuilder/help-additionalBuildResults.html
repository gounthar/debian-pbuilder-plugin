<p>
    When running a build in the chroot environment, there are occasionally
    files that you must retrieve from the chroot that are not part of the 
    normal build.  For example, some files that you may need to get back 
    would include test results, auto-generated files, etc.<br/>
    <br/>
    Set this variable in order to get the files back from the chroot build 
    environment.<br/>
    <br/>
    The files that are retrieved will also automatically be archived as well 
    with the other build results.<br/>
    <br/>
    This must be a comma-separated list; spaces are allowed.
